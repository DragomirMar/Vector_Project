# Programming 2 - University of Vienna (Vector)

>This is the first project from the course Programming 2 in University of Vienna, where we had to create our own class "Vector" with all basic functionalities of the usual vector class, using Iterators.

- The main file is ***vector.h***.

 - ***doctest.h*** amd ***utest.cpp*** files are checking if the vector has needed functionalities and are provided by the professors.

 - In the ***Vector_SS22_Implementierung.pdf*** you can find the complete instructions of the task.
